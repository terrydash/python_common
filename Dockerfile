Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to formally submit my resignation from my position as Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team Leader at Citi, with my last day being May 11, 2023. Due to unforeseen family circumstances, I must prioritize my personal commitments and focus on my family's well-being at this time.

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that Citi has provided me during my tenure. I have grown professionally and personally while working with the company, and I am grateful for the support and guidance I have received from my colleagues and you.

However, I would also like to share some concerns I have had during my time in the SRE team. While I understand that differences in opinions and approaches are inevitable in a professional setting, there have been instances where I felt that the team's collaboration and communication could be improved. I believe that fostering a more open and supportive environment would benefit the team's efficiency and overall morale.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition for my colleagues and the projects I have been involved with. I will work diligently to hand over my responsibilities and knowledge to my successor or any designated team member to minimize any disruption in our team's operations. Please let me know how I can be of assistance during this transition period.

I have informed HR about my resignation, and I will be in touch with them to complete the necessary paperwork and formalities. I hope that my time at Citi has been meaningful and that my contributions have made a positive impact on the organization.

Thank you once again for your understanding, and I wish you and the SRE team continued success in the future.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
